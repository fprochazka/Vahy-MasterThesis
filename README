Reinforcement Learning of Risk-Averse Policies in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes

The paper implementation itself is in ".../MasterThesis/PaperSandbox/src/main/java/vahy/paperGenerics/"

The Java-CLP libraries are provided and the whole program was tested on Windows OS.

How to start:

1. Install JRE 11+ and latest Maven build tool on your system
2. Clone this repository
3. In root directory (.../MasterThesis/), execute command "mvn clean install -Dcheckstyle.skip -DskipTests". It will build the whole project.
4. Prepared HallwayGame examples can be found in .../MasterThesis/HallwayGame/src/main/java/vahy/solutionExamples/ path
5. To execute some prepared example, in directory "../MasterThesis/HallwayGame/" execute command "mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="vahy.solutionExamples.<name of the class with main() to be executed>""
    - example: "mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="vahy.solutionExamples.Benchmark01Solution""

6. The training will start. For some benchmarks, it can take time.
7. When a logging is set to "Info" level (it is by default), three windows will pop up showing training performance over time.
8. After evaluation is done, results are printed into info level log.
